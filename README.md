## Deep Learning course 
    In this course you will learn the basics of deep learning. We'll start with a recap of linear models and discuss stochastic optimization methods that are crucial for training deep neural networks. 
    Then you will study all popular building blocks of neural networks including fully connected layers, convolutional and recurrent layers. You will use these building blocks to define complex modern architectures in TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. 
    In the course project you will implement a deep neural network for the task of image captioning which solves the problem of giving a text description for an input image.
